    <ul>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Chicken Breast</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk garlic, rice vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, Sriracha, hoisin, and sesame oil together in a mixing bowl for the dressing.</li>
        <li>Tear chicken apart into strands similar in width to the spaghetti. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
